\section{Acknowledgments}
First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to Professor Peter Boncz not only for his help and advices during our work,
but also for the chance to obtain hands on experience dealing with real-world big data problems.

We would also like to thank Iakovos Kolokasis from the Institute of Computer Science of Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-FORTH),
for helping us understand some complex parts of the graph theory and also for computing the results of the Local Clustering Coefficient from 2014 until 2016.

This work was carried out on a small part of the Dutch national e-infrastructure with the support of SURF Cooperative.
