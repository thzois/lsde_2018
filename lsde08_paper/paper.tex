% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}

Plethora of goods and services provided by the Internet for exchange, have mandated the use of an anonymous payment system that does not pass through a central authority. The Bitcoin is the first of what we call cryptocurrencies and it is served by the Blockchain as its public transaction ledger. 
Over the last 10 years the Bitcoin gained a significant amount of users. Current statistics show that everyday almost 255.000 transactions are made.
Those transactions form a temporal graph and in this work we observe them and analyze the structure evolution of the Blockchain for each year, from 2009 until the March of 2017. For that reason, it is important to measure some critical and indicative for-the-graph metrics, such as Size, Diameter, Clustering Coefficient, Triangle Participation Ratio, Bridge Ratio and Conductance. Our findings show that the graph became an enormous chain of transactions data as the years passed by, with its size surged from 11.000 transaction to 4.8 billion at 2009 and 2015 respectively.
