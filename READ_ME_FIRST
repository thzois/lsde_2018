Spark/SparkSQL version: 2.1.1 		Scala version: 2.11.8
	- We need sbt -sbt-version 0.13.17 because of Java 7
	- We use version 1.1.2 of hadoopcryptoledger-ds (just to know the schema) because of Java 7

Data:
	- We have stored at HDFS the following:
		1. /user/lsde08/block.schema -> Contains the block schema
		2. /user/lsde08/graph_communities -> Contains the edges and the vertices of the community that conductance is computed for each year
		3. /user/lsde08/graph_partitions -> Contains the edges as parquet files for each year and month

Output:
	- The output is printed at the stdout

Visualization:
	- The website needs to be uploaded on a server for two reasons:
		1. Charts are autogenerated and read files to plot the results (GET request)
		2. gexf-js that is used for the graph visualization has a bug (it is known in their repo)
